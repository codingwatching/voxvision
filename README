My voxel octrees library implemented in C + the simplest renderer with 2 sets of data.

How to build:
1) Install Boehm-GC and SDL
2) cd into directory with this file.
3) mkdir mybuild && cd mybuild && cmake .. && make

Now try either execute './simple-renderer/test_renderer skull 0' or './simple-renderer/test_renderer tree 0'.

I hope that someday it will be possible to use this library in games or same applications, so any reductions
to this use case are possible. Use of any x86-only features is also possible in future with or without
provision of portable code.
