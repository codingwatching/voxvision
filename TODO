TODO list for unforseen future:

Hard and medium changes:
1. Introduce a new tree node type which holds holes in space instead of solid voxels.
   1.1 Rewrite insertion/deletion and search algorithms.
2. Level of details. Maybe do not render those voxels which are only a few pixels in width.
3. Render image with 4x4 squares. Exploit "locality" in each square.
   3.1 Do something with possible quality degradation.
4. Add some FPS games experience.
   4.1 Write a new camera with 5 degrees of freedom (with one rotation axis "locked").
   4.2 Maybe write utility functions for fast replacement of camera methods. Maybe write a dummy camera.
   4.3 Add gravity to collision detector.
5. Maybe store the camera's basis in its structure. Rotate using this basis (for much more fast rotation).

Easy changes:
1. Allow dynamic modification of the voxel tree in lua engine (just like as in demo application).
2. Screen geometry must not bring destortion in rendered scene.
